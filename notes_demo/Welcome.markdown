This is a demo of my "notes " app

The Github repo is at [https://github.com/Corion/App-notes-htmx](https://github.com/Corion/App-notes-htmx)

If you have Firefox, you can enable the `masonry` mode for much nicer layout:

Type `about:config` in the address bar, and set `layout.css.grid-template-masonry-value` to true.
