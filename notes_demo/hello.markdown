# Welcome!

This is a first note

yzzaaqqbbbnnnqweqweqwe And here is more text that..

is rendered *through a roundtrip* weirdly enough. But that gives a `half-wysiwyg` approach to things. Good enough. But the autosave is missing? Sometimes?! But when?

# Checklists

* [ ] A checklist (not sortable, checkable unless manually editing the note...)
  * Hierarchies exist
  * [ ] Checkable too
* [x] Another item
* [x] ~A done item~


Also some new stuff that doesn't update, because we're not sending the stuff ass OOB. Dynamically setting the OOB attribute fixes that.
